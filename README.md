# Acid and Base
* More than 13 million chemical compound.
* They are commonly divided into acid and base.
* The pH is determined by the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> presented in compound mixture.
* The connection between H<sup>+</sup> concentration and pH (Potential of Hydrogen) value written as : $pH=-log(H^{+}(aq))$
## Acid
***
* Has one or more hydrogen first in its formula.
* They donate a proton and accept a electron pair.
* The hydrogen present first are acidic and others are non-acidic(HC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> - acetic acid).
* For acidic the hydrogen must be held loosely to break under certain condition.
* Acids are also classified:
    + Strong acid 
    + Weak acid
* Acid that ionize completely when dissolved in water are Strong acid. In other words, when acid react with water a higher number of hydrogen ions represent the acid is strong.
* Due to the strong polarity between H atom and remaining atom the hydrogen atom released. 
* They are corrosive and damage to metals and organic materials.
* Acid that don't ionize completely are Weak acid (i.e. the less count of hydrogen ion in water when acid react with it.)
* Few have no hydrogen as first, they are known as salts of acid and they release hydrogen under certain condition. they have one or more hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> - acid;NaHSO<sub>4</sub>).

##Base
***
* Has one or more hydroxide ions(OH) in the formula.
* This hydroxide ions are released under certain conditions.
* At high concentration level they are very corrosive and damaging to metals and also to plant and animal tissue.(Strong base)
* Weak base, ionize slightly when dissolved in water.

##Reason
***
* In water (H<sub>2</sub>O), when the compound is mixed:
    1. if hydroxide ions are consumed, then it create acidic condition by releasing hydrogen ions. 
    2. if hydrogen ions are consumed, then it create base condition by releasing hydroxide ions.
